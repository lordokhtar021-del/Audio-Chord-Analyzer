# Chord Progression Analyzer - Project Plan

## Overview
Full-stack chord progression analyzer with audio upload, real-time analysis, interactive timeline, chord audition, and MIDI export. All analysis runs in-house using librosa and custom algorithms.

---

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Audio Upload ✅
**Goal**: Set up project structure, database models, audio upload system, and basic UI layout

- [x] Install required audio processing libraries (librosa, soundfile, numpy, scipy)
- [x] Create SQLAlchemy database models (Project, Track, Analysis, Chord)
- [x] Build audio upload component with file validation (MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG, M4A)
- [x] Implement audio I/O service for file handling and preprocessing
- [x] Create main application layout with header, sidebar, and content area
- [x] Add project state management for current project and analysis status

---

## Phase 2: Audio Analysis Pipeline & Waveform Visualization ✅
**Goal**: Implement beat/tempo detection, key detection, chord recognition, and display waveform

- [x] Implement beat detection service using librosa (tempo and beat grid extraction)
- [x] Build key detection using Krumhansl-Schmuckler algorithm
- [x] Create chord recognition service with template matching and chroma features
- [x] Implement analysis pipeline with progressive results (beats → key → chords)
- [x] Build waveform generation service and display component
- [x] Add background job processing for analysis with progress tracking

---

## Phase 3: Interactive Timeline & Chord Audition ✅
**Goal**: Build interactive timeline with synchronized playback, clickable chords, and MIDI export

- [x] Create timeline component with canvas-based rendering (waveform, beats, measures, chords)
- [x] Implement transport controls (play, pause, stop, seek)
- [x] Build chord panel showing detailed chord information with confidence scores
- [x] Add chord audition feature (click chord to hear it synthesized)
- [x] Implement MIDI export functionality with mido
- [x] Add chord editing capability (manual label correction with confidence display)
